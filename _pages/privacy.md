<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Last updated: November 27, 2025</p>
<p>This notice explains what personal data we collect, how we use it to deliver your TCF membership, and the choices you have. We collect only what we need to provide the app, handle your subscriptions, and improve quality.</p>

<h2>What we collect</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Account data:</strong> email address you provide to sign in or contact support.</li>
<li><strong>Subscription data:</strong> purchase receipts and identifiers from Apple App Store and our subscription provider (RevenueCat) so we can activate and verify your plan.</li>
<li><strong>Usage and diagnostics:</strong> app interactions, performance and crash data, and device identifiers (e.g., device model, OS version). These are used in aggregate and are not used to track you across apps.</li>
</ul>
<p>We do <strong>not</strong> collect precise location, contacts, photos, or payment card numbers. We do not use third-party advertising SDKs or tracking for ad targeting.</p>
<p><strong>No tracking / ads:</strong> We do not share data with ad networks or use it for cross-app tracking. The Service does not request tracking permission.</p>

<h2>How we use data</h2>
<ul>
<li>Provide core features (sync content, show your membership status, restore purchases).</li>
<li>Process and validate subscriptions (including renewals and refunds) through Apple and RevenueCat.</li>
<li>Improve reliability and detect fraud or abuse.</li>
<li>Respond to your requests or support tickets.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Service providers</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Apple App Store:</strong> billing and subscription management.</li>
<li><strong>RevenueCat:</strong> purchase receipt validation and entitlement management.</li>
<li><strong>Analytics / crash reporting:</strong> used only for diagnostics and quality, not advertising.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Subscriptions and auto-renewal</h2>
<p>If you buy a subscription, payment is processed by Apple. Subscriptions renew automatically unless you cancel at least 24 hours before the current period ends. You can cancel anytime in Apple ID Settings &gt; Subscriptions. Removing the app does not cancel an active subscription.</p>

<h2>Sharing</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Service providers:</strong> Apple App Store and RevenueCat for in-app purchases; analytics and crash tools for diagnostics only.</li>
<li><strong>Legal/safety:</strong> if required by law or to protect our users, Company, or Service.</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not sell personal data.</p>

<h2>Retention</h2>
<p>We keep personal data only as long as needed for the purposes above or to meet legal obligations. If you delete your account or request deletion, we remove or anonymize data unless we must keep it for legal reasons.</p>

<h2>Your choices and rights</h2>
<ul>
<li>Access, correct, or delete your data by contacting us.</li>
<li>Opt out of non-essential analytics in-app where available.</li>
<li>Uninstall the app or stop using the Service at any time.</li>
</ul>
<p>To submit a request, email <a href="mailto:hi@freetcf.com">hi@freetcf.com</a>. We may verify your identity before acting on requests.</p>

<h2>Children</h2>
<p>The Service is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect their personal data. If you believe a child provided data, contact us to delete it.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>
<p>We use technical and organizational safeguards to protect your data, but no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>

<h2>International transfers</h2>
<p>Data may be processed in countries where we or our providers operate. We apply protections consistent with this policy.</p>

<h2>Changes</h2>
<p>We may update this policy. We will post changes here and update the “Last updated” date. Material changes will be highlighted in-app or on the site.</p>
